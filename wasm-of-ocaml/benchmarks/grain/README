Bug with installed version of Grain (1.0)

Curried functions produce a webassembly error: function signature mismatch
Suggests that indirect call is getting a function with the wrong type.

Rather than spend time debugging reason/trying to fix, download v2 of Grain, install that, and rewrite tests with its syntax.

test.gr is a minimal example of a program that breaks.
Also breaks composition.gr and others had to be rewritten to avoid the issue (e.g. writing map using a tuple rather than curried)

Memory info:
Have modified the grain source so that runtime.src.core.memory.TRACE_MEMORY = __DEBUG
Have also set trace to do nothing and created new abstrace function just for summary stats.
Have removed __DEBUG from Webpack.common as it is set in both of dev and prod and doesn't get overriden otherwise.
To print memory info when running, rebuild by going to grain dir and running `yarn runtime build:dev`
To remove memory tracking/overhead, repeat with `yarn runtime build`
This way, no overhead when not printing memory stats, and no excessive printing of intermediate data when we are tracking it.
Probably still a slight overhead so be cautious of how big an input it is run on.

Avoided using --limitMemory option since it seems to cause programs to get stuck or run far far slower, not practical to use.
