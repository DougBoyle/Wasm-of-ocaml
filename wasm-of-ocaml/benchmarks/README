alldata.sh effectively runs all of the benchmark programs and stores their output in the same file.
Needs labelling to separate ocaml/C/grain/js
Have to collect grain memory data separately due to needing to switch runtime (just use dev all the time?)

Lots of work unnecessarily repeated e.g. file size and memory usage where deterministic.
Now I have a full script to do it all, may want to rewrite some of the runners.

Also need to fix file formatting. Indenting is a mess currently.

Also need to make note of differences between test files e.g. fewer iterations in Grain, more in JS_of_ocaml?

Save results to a separate directory.

Can specify options by passing in args when running the script. They appear as $1, $2, ... and $# is number of args.
Common to use the commands getopts and shift to avoid having to consider lots of permutations of arguments.

Check order of outputs lines up i.e. filename execTime fileSize memoryUsed

Takes about 4 mins to run
