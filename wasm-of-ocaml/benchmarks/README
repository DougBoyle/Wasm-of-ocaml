alldata.sh effectively runs all of the benchmark programs and stores their output in the same file.
Needs labelling to separate ocaml/C/grain/js
Have to collect grain memory data separately due to needing to switch runtime (just use dev all the time?)

Lots of work unnecessarily repeated e.g. file size and memory usage where deterministic.
Now I have a full script to do it all, may want to rewrite some of the runners.

Can specify options by passing in args when running the script. They appear as $1, $2, ... and $# is number of args.
Common to use the commands getopts and shift to avoid having to consider lots of permutations of arguments.

Check order of outputs lines up i.e. filename execTime fileSize memoryUsed

Takes about 7.5 mins to run at 10 iterations each

Unified tests so that, where iterations differ, specified in file name.
Output (when all on 1 line) is filename time heapusage filesize
Currently set to only do 5 iterations of each, can change at top of script
