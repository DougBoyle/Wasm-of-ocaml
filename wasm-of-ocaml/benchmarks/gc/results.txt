Demonstrating difference between unoptimised and improved version:

Allocate 8040 cells of various sizes, including 402 large cells.
Corresponds to 3 pages in old version, 4 pages in new version (due to trailers)
Free those 402 cells as well as 4020 of the small cells.

Repeatedly allocate and release those 402 large cells, penalty for old version
as it must scan over 10 small cells for each large cell it allocates, whereas
new version uses bins

In both cases, data collected with all tracing information disabled to maximise performance

Old Version: (number is how many times those 402 cells re-allocated)
