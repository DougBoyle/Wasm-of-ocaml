	abstract = {We present improvements to the backtracking technique of pattern-matching compilation. Several optimizations are introduced, such as commutation of patterns, use of exhaustiveness information, and control flow optimization through the use of labeled static exceptions and context information. These optimizations have been integrated in the Objective-Caml compiler. They have shown good results in increasing the speed of pattern-matching intensive programs, without increasing final code size.},

abstract = {We address the issue of compiling ML pattern matching to compact and efficient decisions trees. Traditionally, compilation to decision trees is optimized by (1) implementing decision trees as dags with maximal sharing; (2) guiding a simple compiler with heuristics. We first design new heuristics that are inspired by necessity, a concept from lazy pattern matching that we rephrase in terms of decision tree semantics. Thereby, we simplify previous semantic frameworks and demonstrate a straightforward connection between necessity and decision tree runtime efficiency. We complete our study by experiments, showing that optimizing compilation to decision trees is competitive with the optimizing match compiler of Le Fessant and Maranget (2001).},

abstract = {From the Publisher: This second editon describes C as defined by the ANSI standard. This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. The book assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. A novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language. FEATURES: All examples have been tested, which is in machine-readable form. It discusses various aspects of C in more detail, although the emphasis is on examples of complete programs, rather than isolated fragments. It deals with basic data types, operators and expressions. Covers functions and program structure, external variables, scope rules, multiple source files, and also touches on the preprocessor. It also describes an interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system, concentrating on input/output, the file system, and storage allocation. It also provides a language reference manual. The official statement of the syntax and semantics of C is the ANSI standard.}
