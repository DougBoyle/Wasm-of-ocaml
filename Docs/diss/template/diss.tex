\section*{Declaration of Originality}

I, \authorname of \authorcollege, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.

I, \authorname of \authorcollege, am content for my dissertation to be made available
to the students and staff of the University.

\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

To produce a compiler from a subset of OCaml to WebAssembly and measure its performance against a set of alternatives for running code in browsers. The core subset of OCaml would support programs operating on integers, without the class/module layer of OCaml. Extensions were to extend the subset supported, such as including floating point operations, implement optimisations and measure their impact, and add a garbage collector to the runtime.


\section*{Work Completed} % Of course update this as the project develops
I implemented the compiler, using the parser and type-checker of the official OCaml compiler, supporting both integer and floating point programs with almost all of the language constructs of OCaml. I wrote tests and benchmark programs and evaluated my compiler against equivalent programs compiled with Js\_of\_ocaml, Grain and clang/LLVM. I also implemented several optimisations and measured their impact on the benchmark programs.

\section*{Special Difficulties}
None.

%% START OF MAIN TEXT

\include{chapters/introduction}

%This is the introduction where you should introduce your work.  In
%general the thing to aim for here is to describe a little bit of the
%context for your work --- why did you do it (motivation), what was the
%hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief
%overview of what you actually did.

%It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into
%this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or
%a particularly interesting finding).

%It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the
%document, although without care this can appear formulaic
%and tedious. Your call.


%A more extensive coverage of what's required to understand your
%work. In general you should assume the reader has a good undergraduate
%degree in computer science, but is not necessarily an expert in
%the particular area you've been working on. Hence this chapter
%may need to summarize some ``text book'' material.

%This is not something you'd normally require in an academic paper,
%and it may not be appropriate for your particular circumstances.
%Indeed, in some cases it's possible to cover all of the ``background''
%material either in the introduction or at appropriate places in
%the rest of the dissertation.

\clearpage
\include{chapters/preparation}

%This chapter covers relevant (and typically, recent) research
%which you build upon (or improve upon). There are two complementary
%goals for this chapter:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item to show that you know and understand the state of the art; and
%  \item to put your work in context
%\end{enumerate}

%Ideally you can tackle both together by providing a critique of
%related work, and describing what is insufficient (and how you do
%better!)

%The related work chapter should usually come either near the front or
%near the back of the dissertation. The advantage of the former is that
%you get to build the argument for why your work is important before
%presenting your solution(s) in later chapters; the advantage of the
%latter is that don't have to forward reference to your solution too
%much. The correct choice will depend on what you're writing up, and
%your own personal preference.



\clearpage
\include{chapters/implementation}

%This chapter may be called something else\ldots but in general
%the idea is that you have one (or a few) ``meat'' chapters which
%describe the work you did in technical detail.

\clearpage
\include{chapters/evaluation}

%For any practical projects, you should almost certainly have
%some kind of evaluation, and it's often useful to separate
%this out into its own chapter.

\clearpage
\include{chapters/conclusion}
%As you might imagine: summarizes the dissertation, and draws
%any conclusions. Depending on the length of your work, and
%how well you write, you may not need a summary here.

%You will generally want to draw some conclusions, and point
%to potential future work.
